# part (a)
# How would you print the file classlist.csv to the screen
# except the two header lines?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.
tail -n+3 classlist.csv #printed all but the first 2 lines



# part (b)
# How would you construct a pipeline using the command from part (a)
# to determine how many distinct students are in this list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the number
# of students in the list.
tail -n+3 classlist.csv | wc -l

number of students: 130


# part (c)
# How would you sort the list by the second column (i.e., by
# "First Name")? Which student (provide first and last name) would be
# at the top of the list? Which student would be at the bottom of the
# list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the names
# of the first and last students in the new list.

tail -n+3 classlist.csv | cut -b11- | sort
sort commands -b -d -f -g -i -M -h -n -R -r -V and --sort all don't work.
I also tried setting a key and using -t
I have no idea what other sort command exists.

so I used cut to take out the student numbers and sorted than

Adam Holte is top of the list, Zenia Mowrer is the bottom

# part (d)
# Construct a Unix pipeline involving these functions to determine
# how many students have the same first name. Which first names are
# repeated in the class list?
# Enter the relevant name(s) and the Unix command(s) below.

tail -n+3 classlist.csv | cut -b11- | (somehow cut out last names) | uniq -d

this will print all duplicated lines allowing me to answer the other two
questions.


# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
# the student number and the first character of the first name to make
# a four-character identifier for each student.
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.

tail -n+3 classlist.csv | cut -b8-12
